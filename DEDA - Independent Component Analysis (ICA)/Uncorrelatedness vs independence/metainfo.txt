Published in: 'DEDA class 2022'

Description: 'Show that uncorrelatedness does not imply independence - the difference between results of PCA and ICA'

Submitted:  '01 Jul 2022'

Keywords: 
- 'Independent Component Analysis (ICA)'
- 'Uncorrelatedness'
- 'Independence'
- 'PCA'
- 'Signal data'

Input: 'the module–"Uncorrelatedness_vs_independence.ipynb" is used to generate simulation signal data, and show the different results of ICA and PCA (the previouos derives independent signals, while the latter only the uncorrelated ones)


Output: 
- 'Compare source and mixing data (artificial).png'
- 'Compare estimates of source data from PCA-FA-ICA (artificial).png'
